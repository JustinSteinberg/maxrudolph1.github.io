Hey! I’m Max, a second year robotics graduate student at Georgia Tech. My research focuses on teaching robots how to do stuff. I use deep reinforcement learning to teach teams of heterogeneous robots to coordinate themselves and quadrupedal robots how to navigate in real-world environments. I graduated from Georgia Tech in May 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering and a minor in robotics.

## Work Experience


## In the Media

I was part of an intern [spotlight](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2020/1/9/intern-turns-head-on-nasas-next-mars-rover/) while working at the Jet Propulsion Lab in case you're interested in what it's like to work as a Mars2020 Intern.

## For Funzies
When I’m not studying ye ole robots, I like to tickle the ivories (piano), smack the fuzzies (tennis), and consume the dough (bake). I'm also a National Parks enthusiast on my jourrney to visiting all the parks.
